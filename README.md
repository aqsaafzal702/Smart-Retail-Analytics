# Smart Retail Analysis using Data Mining

This project performs a comprehensive data mining analysis on a retail transaction dataset to uncover valuable customer insights. It applies various machine learning and pattern mining techniques for segmentation, recommendation, and classification.

## Key Components

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, handling missing values, scaling, and PCA.
- **Similarity Analysis**: Euclidean distance and Jaccard similarity heatmaps.
- **Clustering**: Customer segmentation using KMeans and DBSCAN.
- **Association Rules**: Apriori vs FP-Growth for frequent itemset mining.
- **Classification**: Na√Øve Bayes and SVM (RBF kernel) for customer prediction.

## Insights & Business Impact

- Identified key customer segments (e.g., loyal, inactive, low-spenders).
- Recommended personalized marketing strategies.
- Built accurate classifiers with up to **99% accuracy** using SVM.

## Tools Used

`Python`, `Scikit-learn`, `Pandas`, `Seaborn`, `Matplotlib`, `MLxtend`
